# JPEG EXIF Tag Viewer
### My first assignment in C  
I completed this project as part of my courseload for Pitt's Introduction to System Software (CS 0449) class.  The assignment 
was to create a C utility to extract the metadata from a JPEG file. 
  
There were several outcomes from this project:
  * An increased understanding of the theory behind developing in the C Language
  * Experience working with an image file at the byte-level
  * Application of C to accomplish a defined task
