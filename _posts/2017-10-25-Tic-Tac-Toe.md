## Tic Tac Toe
### A Simple Python Experiment
This Tic-Tac-Toe application is a simple bit of Python code that I decided to work on in order to improve my Python exposure as well as play around with graphical
programming techniques with Tkinter.  The code itself was not terribly difficult to implement, as there are no truly taxing algorithms in such a simple game.
The entirity of the code is available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/jkd28/Tic-Tac-Toe" target="_blank">here</a>.
